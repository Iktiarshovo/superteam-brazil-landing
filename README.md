## ⚡ A Tribute to the Solana Ecosystem 🇧🇷

Instead of submitting a static Figma prototype, I went the extra mile to build a **High-Fidelity Live Website** using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vanilla JS**.

### Why I did this:

- **Interactive Logic:** You can test the Real-time Member Search & Filtering logic on the Members page.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Validated on real devices for a native-app feel.
- **Open Source:** I made the code public so anyone can use it to build their community site.

### The Real Reason (My "Why") �

Honestly, the **Solana ecosystem** has saved me multiple times financially through airdrops when I had nothing. I built this project as a **personal tribute** to give back to the community that supported me. I am happy to contribute to Superteam Brazil's growth, prize or no prize.
